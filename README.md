# Validator.js
Validator.js is a tiny javascript framework designed to make client side textbox validation easier. It will validate on input and use a predefined regex so you dont have to search for one. If you still want to use your own regex or expand on the system, you can do that too.

## Syntax
Before we get started we will go over the syntax. Validation.js has its own selector.
```javascript
Val("#IdHere");
```

As you can see you can select an element using this method, not unlike JQuery. Thatâ€™s all the syntax you need to know and you could even replace it with pure javascript or another framework if you prefer.
